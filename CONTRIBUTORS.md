# Contributing to XSLT Blender

This project is a spinoff of a spinoff ([OSCAL Toolsa](http://pages.nist.gov/oscal-tools)). It currently has no formal organization and no immediate plans for formal organization beyond this repository presence. All code is being placed in the public domain in order to make it free to use.

Until it does, the best way to contribute to the project is:

- <q>Borrow</q> while giving credit to your sources
- Demonstrate applications and extensions
- Advocate for them and for new possible applications and ideas
- Let us know

For the last item, you can use Issues on this site or contact us through the [OSCAL Project](http://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL).

Note that in view of the possibility that it may receive public contributions, and in the hope and expectation that users and contributors all find themselves to be welcome to participate in its development, this site also has a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
